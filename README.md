# âœ¨ I'm Hannah and I make beautiful things for interesting people. âœ¨ 

## Here's a bit about me:

- **I'm a Design Engineer and loving it!**
- I've been a front end developer for 10 years professionally.
- I have a BFA in Fashion Design and I've been licenced to do hair in two states.
- I knit voraciously, dance prolifically, and run often.
- I'm a proud parent of a very vocal cat ðŸ™€.

But most importantly, I really enjoy talking shop and learning more about the tools I use every day.

... and more!  Ask me about which design system I'm currently poking around with!

## Current Stats:

I may not push code in my free time as prolifically as I once did, but I do enjoy tinkering quite a bit.
